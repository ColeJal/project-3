##  We explored the Natural Disaster occurences from around the world. The dataset used compiled each natural disaster in the EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database).  
**_The following criteria must be met in order for an event to be entered into the database:_**
###  -    Deaths: 10 of more people deaths
###  -    Affected: 100 or more people affected/injured/homeless.
###  -    Declaration/international appeal: Declaration by the country of a state of emergency and/or an appeal for international assistance


## Objectives
- Identify the areas on Earth that are most affected by natural disasters.
- Uncover any relationship between climate change and the earth's weather.
- Identify trends that uncover information predicting future disasters.
- Identify the total deaths that occur as a result of natural disasters.
- Visualize and present the data on natural disasters over the past century. 







## ðŸš€ Fun Facts

1) 	Between 2000 and 2012, natural disasters caused $1.7 trillion in damage and affected 2.9 billion people  

2)  Over 1/2 of the victims of both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy were senior citizens over the age of 65. Work with seniors to create an emergency plan in case of a disaster.  

3)  Nearly 50% of the fatalities caused by natural disasters in 2012 were due to hydrological events like flooding or mass movements
